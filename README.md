# Projects
Hello, Iâ€™m Noah Leonard. My passion lies in becoming a skilled developer while enjoying the creative journey along the way. I am committed to building a variety of projects designed to assist others and to challenge my own abilities in innovation and problem-solving. Originally from London, I spent two years in New York before returning home.
